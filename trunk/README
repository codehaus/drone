Thanks for downloading Drone!

Visit the docs directory for more information about how to install,
configure and run the IRC bot.

You can also go to the Drone's website at http://drone.codehaus.org to gather
up-to-date information.

In a later revision more docs will be included in the release.

Have fun!
